**Total Chaos Catan** is a Catan variant with **no turns**; all players play at
the same time. The goal is to lessen the total play time of a game and make it
more chaotic. Since all players are going at the same time, there’s no good way
to verify that everyone is doing everything correctly; only play Total Chaos
Catan with players who have a good idea of how to play normal Catan and who
will not cheat.

## The Arbiter

The arbiter controls the flow of the game by keeping track of time and rolling
dice. It is best that a computer program be the arbiter; however, an extra
player may be the arbiter if the computer program is not available. A human
arbiter must have dice, a timer (which is visible to the players), and a random
number generator at hand.

## Board Setup

The Catan island should be set up in the middle of the table. Split each
resource and development card deck into multiple banks, creating as many banks
as is necessary for no one to have to reach excessively far to reach a bank.

## Initial Settlement Placement

At the start of the game, the arbiter randomly selects the order in which
players will place their initial settlements; the rest of initial settlement
placement continues as in normal Catan. If a player takes too long to place a
settlement, a time limit may be enforced at the arbiter’s discretion.

## The Rest of the Game

The rest of the game is split into multiple phases. Each phase has a time
limit. After the time limit is reached, the arbiter will call time and players
must move to the next phase. (Optionally, the arbiter may add a small break
between phases.) If all players agree to end the phase before the time limit is
reached, they may do so. Each turn, the following phases occur in this order:

### Resource Phase

Recommended time limit: 20 seconds

1. The arbiter will roll one pair of dice for each player (e.g. in a 4-player
   game, the arbiter will roll 4 pairs of dice).
2. Players then collect resources accordingly.
3. If there are not enough resources to supply all players, the first player(s)
   to grab the cards get the resources.
4. If any 7s are rolled, the arbiter randomly selects a player to control the
   robber.

### Robber Phase, Part 1

Recommended time limit: 20 seconds

This phase **only occurs if a 7 was rolled** during the Resource Collection Phase.

1. All players with 8 or more resources must discard half of them (rounding
   down).
2. All players who do not have control over the robber shuffle their hands in
   preparation for **Robber Phase, Part 2**.

### Robber Phase, Part 2

Recommended time limit: 20 seconds

This phase **only occurs if a 7 was rolled** during the Resource Collection Phase.

1. The player with control of the robber moves the robber to a hexagon of their
   choosing. 
2. They may choose any player with a settlement or city on that hexagon to
   steal resources from, one resource for every 7 rolled (e.g. if two 7s are
   rolled, the robber steals two resources).
    - The robber may either steal a resource that both the targeted player and
      the robbing player agree on, or the robber may steal a random resource
      from the targeted player’s hand.
3. If the time limit is reached before the player with control of the robber
   has stolen all of the cards they can, their remaining steals are lost and they
   may no longer steal cards.

### Building & Trading Phase

Recommended time limit: 1 minute

1. Players may build, trade resources, and play development cards, all at the
   same time.
    - All actions occur in real time; if multiple actions conflict, the one
      which was played first gets priority.
2. If another player achieves Longest Road or Largest Army, they take the
   plaque and two points immediately.
3. Development cards bought cannot be used until the next Building & Trading
   Phase.

### Cooldown Phase

Recommended time limit: 20 seconds

1. Players reorganize the mess they made during the other phases.
    - If the island was bumped, readjust the tiles back to how they should be.
    - Center roads, settlements, and cities.
2. If any bank is running low on any resource, use the other banks to replenish
   it.
    - If there are not enough resources for all banks to have a reasonable
      amount, divide them between the banks as fairly as possible such that
      each player has an equal opportunity to grab them first.
